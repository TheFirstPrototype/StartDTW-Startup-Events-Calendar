# Detroit Startup Events Calendar

## Introduction

Contains the code that is used to display the [curated calendar of startup events in Detroit](https://thefirstprototype.com/detroit-startup-events/)

## Notes

- The problem is challenging because there are so many sources of information and most don't have an RSS feed.
- Currently this tool refreshes every 30 minutes & is using a cached version in order to serve the data frequestly
- The hope is to expand this and add more features in the future!
- Dev Note: The code is open-source, so feel free to contribute with design or logic by submitting a Pull Request to the code.
- Currently we scrape data from several sources - Velocity, Bamboo, SBDC, Oakland Thrive, Creative Morning, BlackTechSaturdays & TechTown! ðŸš€
